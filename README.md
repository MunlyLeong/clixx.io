Rapid Configuration and Prototyping System
------------------------------------------

If there's an electronics or computing project that you've wanted to make 
then clixx.io offers a collection of computer and electronics boards and software
to allow you to easily get it done.

Just assemble the computer boards in the configuration that you need, and
the hard work of wiring them all together is already done. It's ready to program.

There's so many good processor boards available these days.

We create peripheral boards that allow you to explore the features 
of the various different processor boards more easily.

ReUse Boards on Different Projects
----------------------------------

clixx.io boards can be used on different projects with little wasteage. If
a project doesn't work, just reconfigure the parts a different way on a
different project. 

CommandLine Interface
---------------------

Most of the Sensor and Interfaces can be driven directly from the Command-Line
Interface.

For example, to turn an LED on:

Use your projects at Work or Home
---------------------------------

clixx.io modules are designed for Industrial use. They have solid mounting
capabilities and are suitable for mounting in area's demanding a higher level
of robustness.
