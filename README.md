========

Clixx.io is cross platform peripherals for Internet Appliances.

It's a collection of devices on a network that talk to each other
with JSON. 

For example, Switches, LEDs and binary devices exchange information
with the 'level' value. Which can be either 'High' or 'Low'.

ADCs, DACs exchange information with 'value' parameter.

There's a Web Interface also under construction making all the
devices able to be driven from the Browser.
