Digital Button
==============

The Digital Button is a very general premade board containing a momentary
switch and a pulldown resistor.

It can be used in any circuit requiring a button and can be mounted either
directly to the circuit board via a digital or analog input.

You can typically add more than one Digital Button to a circuit and
combine them with other electronics such as LED's or switches to make
them do useful tasks.
